Inversion transform sampling (AKA *inversion sampling, inverse probability integral transform, inverse transformation method, Smirnov transform*), is a basic method for pseudo-random number sampling.

It maps uniform samples from $[,0)$ to a given 1D probability distribution by inverting the distributionâ€™s CDF.
