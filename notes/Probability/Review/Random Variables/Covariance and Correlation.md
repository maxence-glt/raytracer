Both describe the degree to which two random variables or sets of random variables tend to deviate from their expected values in similar ways

>Recall:
>$\mu_X=E(X) ; \mu_Y=E(Y)$
>$\sigma_X^2=E[(X-\mu_X)^2] ; \sigma_Y^2=E[(Y-\mu_Y)^2]$
>
>The **Covariance** of X and Y is defined as follows:
>$$\large Cov[X, Y] = E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)]=E(XY)-E(X)E(Y)=\sigma_{XY}$$
>Covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables

>The **Correlation Coefficient**
>$$\large \rho = \frac{Cov(X, Y)}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}=\frac{\sigma_{XY}}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$$
>It measures the direction and strength of their linear relationship
