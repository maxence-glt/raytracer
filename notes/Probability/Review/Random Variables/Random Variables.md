**Remember**: Sample Space is the set of all possible outcomes
Sometimes, it is more convenient to describe the elements of $S$ as a number

> Given a random experiment with an outcome space $S$, a function $X$ that assigns one and only one number $X(s)=x$ to each element $s$ in $S$ is called a **random variable**. The **space** of $X$ is the set of real numbers where $s\in S$ means that the element $s$ belongs to the set $S$

#### Discrete Random Variables
The space of $X$ can be thought of as the sample space for the problem, and we can denote it as $S$. $S$ is called the **support** of $X$.
- If $S$ is a subset of real numbers, and contains a **countable** number of points, we call $S$ a **discrete sample space**
- Any random variable $X$ with sample space $S$ is called a **discrete random variable**

[[Moments]] of a function in mathematics are certain quantitative measures related to the shape of the function's graph
