- For a random variable $X$, the probability that the random variable takes a value, $x$, is $P(X=x)$
- This is typically denoted by $f(x)$
- $f(x)$ is called the **probability mass function (PMF)**

It must satisfy 3 properties
1. $f(x)>0$, $x\in S$
2. $\sum_{x\in S}f(x)=1$
3. $P(X\in A)=\sum_{x\in A}f(x)$, where $A \subset S$
