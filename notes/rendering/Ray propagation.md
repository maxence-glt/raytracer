We need to know what happens to the light traveling along a ray as it passes through space. If we are rendering a scene in a vacuum, light energy remains constant along a ray. Although true vacuums are unusual on Earth, they are a reasonable approximation for many environments. More sophisticated models are available for tracing rays through fog, smoke, the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, and so on.
