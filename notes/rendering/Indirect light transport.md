Because light can arrive at a surface after bouncing off or passing through other surfaces, it is usually necessary to trace additional rays to capture this effect.

In general, the amount of light that reaches the camera from a point on an object is given by the sum of light emitted by the object (if it is itself a light source) and the amount of reflected light. This is formalized by the _light transport equation_ (also often known as the [[rendering equation]]).
