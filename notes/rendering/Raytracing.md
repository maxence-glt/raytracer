Simply, raytracing follows the path of a ray of [[light]] through a scene as it interacts with and bounces off objects in an environment.

The components of a raytracer:
- [[Camera]]
- [[Rayâ€“object intersections]]
- [[Light sources]]
- [[Visibility]]
- [[Light scattering at surfaces]]
- [[Indirect light transport]]
- [[Ray propagation]]
