Simply, raytracing follows the path of a ray of [[light]] through a scene as it interacts with and bounces off objects in an environment.

The components of a raytracer:
- [[Camera]]
- [[Rayâ€“object intersections]]
- [[Light sources]]
- [[Visibility]]
- [[Light scattering at surfaces]]
- [[Indirect light transport]]
- [[Ray propagation]]

Full ray tracers ar econceptually divided into three phases of execution. 
1. Parses the scene description file provided by the user. 
2. Creates specific objects corresponding to the scene.
3. Main rendering loop executes (majority of running time)
