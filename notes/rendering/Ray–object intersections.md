We must be able to tell precisely where a given ray intersects a given geometric object. In addition, we need to determine certain properties of the object at the intersection point, such as a surface normal or its material. Most ray tracers also have some facility for testing the intersection of a ray with multiple objects, typically returning the closest intersection along the ray.
