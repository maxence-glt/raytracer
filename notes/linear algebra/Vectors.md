>In the general $n$-dimensional case, a frame’s origin $p_o$ and its $n$ linearly independent basis vectors define an $n$-dimensional _affine space_. 

All vectors $v$ in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors. Given a vector $v$ and the basis vectors $v_i$, there is a unique set of scalar values such that $v=s_1v_1 +...+s_nv_n$.

Similarly, for all points $p$ there are unique scalars $s_i$ such that the point can be expressed in terms of the origin $p_o$ and the basis vectors $p=p_o+s_1v_1+...+s_nv_n$.
