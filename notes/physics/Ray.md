Represented in *parametric* form with

> $r(t) = o + td$
> Where o is the ray's origin, d is its direction vector, and t is a parameter whose legal range is [0, inf)

It is often easy to find the intersection between the ray and a surface defined by an implicit function, and substituting the ray equation into the implicit equation, producing a new function whose only parameter is t.

>$F(x, y, z) = 0$ (implicit function)

>example:
>$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - r^2 = 0$
>Substituting the ray equation we get
>$(o_x + td_x)^2 + (o_y + td_y)^2 + (o_z + td_z)^2 + - r^2 = 0$
